  Ben Rotter September 2016

  Ben Strutt and Cosmin created a nice correlator, so how about I try to use that and see how it compares to
  Abby's.  Abby doesn't really reconstruct WAIS pulses very well, so either it is a filtering issue on her end,
  or there is something much more pathalogical with her code?  Either way, if this works I can integrate it in
  to her code and re-run all the events with a more "modern" correlator

  This takes FOREVER to run.  So what I want to do is set it up so it can do it run by run on the big servers.
  That way I can get through all the events without having to wait as long at least.

  So lets do:
  argc=1:
   argv[0] = scriptName (like it always will be)
             otherwise will process all events in runs 330 to 360
  argc=2:
   argv[0] = same as above
   argv[1] = single runNumber to work with (all events in that run)
  argc=3:
   argv[0] = save as above
   argv[1] = runNumber to START at (all events in that run)
   argv[2] = runNumber to STOP at (all events in that run too)
  argc=4:
   argv[0:2] = same as above
   argv[3] =  number of entries to look at (over several runs!)
  argc=5:
   argv[0:2] = same as above
   argv[3] = TChain entry number to start with
   argv[4] = TChain entry number to stop with
  argc=6:
   argv[0:4] = same as above
   argv[5] = special post-fix to add to output file name (since I have to batch run this)
